# Data115_Personal_Project
This is the repository that is responsible for holding my personal dataset project!
This plot compares the homers of each player to the batting average of the players, it does not include any specific players, it just portrays the number of homers compared to the batting averages. The purpose was to see if more home runs causes a lower batting average, so if you look at the plot it puts the homers correlated with that players specific batting average and you can see that the players with the most homers have lower batting averages than the players with less homers. This is typically because the players with higher batting averages are not always trying to destroy the ball, they just put good swings on the ball and the result is the result. The players with the most homers swing for the fence every time and because of this they do not produce as many hits and their batting average suffers for it.
