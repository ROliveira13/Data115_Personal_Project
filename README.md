This is the repository that is responsible for holding my personal dataset project!

MOTIVATION:

For this poject I wanted to choose a topic that I was truly interest in that had data that I could analyze from multiple angles. Baseball has been in my life ever since I was a kid and I have grown to fall in love with it, and I love the statistical analyzation of players from the MLB. One of the biggest questions in today's MLB era is how the homerun ball is effecting the performance of big league hitters, many people argue that players are worse than before because their primary focus is on hitting homeruns. For my project I wanted to dive deep into the stats of the top 50 batters from the 2019 season and I wanted to see if their homerun count affected their other stats, and how well they compare to players with lower totals.

Data Process:

The data process for this data set was actually quite annoying but I was able to fix it up so that I had clean data to create visualizations from. I pulled my data straight from the MLB webiste(link inlcuded at the top and the bottom and it was not very easy to pull and put into an excelt sheet. I copy and pasted the data that I needed into an excel spreadsheet but that data came out a little wonky, as you can see is book5.xlsx. I decided that I needed to elimanate some lines from the data, some extra white lines that were causing the excel sheet to look funny. I also needed to change the size and the font of the data to make all the columns look the same, the names of the players was much larger and it was in a blue font. I got lucky with my data because the website pre-organized the data so all the numbers there were essential to my analysis, so I did not have to eliminate any unnecessary data points. The data process for this project consisted of cleaning up the raw data from the website, making my spreadhseet more organized and finally cleaning up the fonts for that data.

VISUALIZATION:

This plot is a representation of homeruns versus batting average and how the number of homers for one  player compared to their batting average. The plot would show the points of the number of homers lines up against the batting average. What I found is that the players with the most amount of homeruns typically have lower batting averages than the players with lower batting averages. This is typically because the players with higher batting averages typically do not swing for the fences, they just put a good swing on the ball and hope for good results. The players with the most homeruns typically swing for the fences every swing and they do not always get the best results.

This plot is a representation of homeruns versus on-base percentage and how the number of homeruns for one player compared to their on-base percentage. In comparison to looking at the batting average the on-base percentage seems to get higher as the number of homeruns rises, and this is typically because players with a lot of power typically are pitched differently than players who do not hit for power. This will typically raise the on-base percentage for the player, but as we can see the rise is not tremendous, indicating that homeruns do not have a huge affect on on-base percentage.

This plot is a representation of homeruns versus sulgging percentage, slugging percentage is a measure of the productivity of a hitter. It measures the total bases for a hitter and divides it by the number of at bats. This means that players who have more doubles, triples and homeruns typically have a higher slugging percentage than players who consistently get singles. The plot that is shown here is a perfect representation of that as it shows that the higher the number of homeruns, the higher the slugging percentage.

This final plot is a representation of homeruns versus OBPS, which is on-base percentage plus the slugging percentage, and this number is one of the best pure representations of how well a player performs as a hitter. The stat takes the on-base percentage and combines it with the slugging percentage to make one super state. Player with over 1.000 OPBS typically excel in the league, and anyone who sits over .900 is considered to be a lethal hitter. When taking a looking at the plot, there is a clear skewness to the left for the data, which would indicate that the higer the total of homeruns for the player, then the higer their OBPS is. Which helps me conclude that if you hit more homeruns then you are most likely to suceed in the league.
